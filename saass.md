#SASS and the SASS Library

This projects aims to build a repository and a body of knowledge for using SASS to generate the CSS used in eBooks. 

I chose SASS as my pre-processor option because I consider it the cleanest solution of them all. It leverages a user's knowledge of CSS and allows some awesome things that are impossible to do with standard CSS elements. 

##What is SASS

SASS (Syntactically Aware Style Sheets) is a superset of CSS3 which offers additional functionality such as: variables (never again type the same value over and over in a stylesheet), nesting, mixins and selector inheritance
